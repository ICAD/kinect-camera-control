    CONSOLE APPLICATION : CameraControlV4 Project Overview
========================================================================

Hello User, 

	Okay so versions 2 and 3 only differ with less functionality and probably less reliability
of the actuall tracking, so I would reccomend using this version. That being said, if you do
not want to zoom functionality then use Version 3.

So what you need is a Cannon VC-C4 camera and a kinect, my files, and the drivers for each installed.

After that you can just run the exe and it will work, although not perferctly, if this project
goes any further then I will put more effort into making this a non coders dream till then it 
is a little finicky

You need to calibrate if you have moved the camera in relation to the kinect,i have mine mounted
on a tripod so it does not move. Calibration problem is that sometimes you need to redo for best
results

Get your skeleton calibrated AND NOTE!!!! do not let your arms cross your chest!!! 

Okay your set, now position your left hand so that the tips of fingers can not be seen in the 
top left corner,keeping that hand there move your right rand so it is past the middle of your 
body. You should see a bunch of lines spew onto the console and then stop. 

Next step move your right hand to the bottom right corner of the screen you may have to get on your 
knees SORRY. Swipe left hand across your body. 




ENJOY

Sincerly
